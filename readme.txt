Display custom field data as widgets

== Description ==

This plugin requires Advanced Custom Fields.

Once you've set up some fields, pick from one of the 4 widgets available (prefixed with BS):
* Image Full - puts an image field into a widget (no border, no other info)
* Image Boxed - puts an image field into a widget, with your theme's styling, a title, and a caption if one is set
* Field - puts a specific custom field into a widget, with a customisable title
* Fieldgroup - puts each field in a fieldgroup in a widget
